### Miscellaneous Info:

The results are virtually endless since all types of human samples come through a lab. Medical lab technicians analyze almost everything in the human body unseen. Any healthcare job is a little unpredictable. Just like a nurse never knows who's going to come through the doors of the emergency room, you truly never know what kind of specimen will come through your lab window.
